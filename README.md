# Quiz Master — Android Native (Kotlin)

A faithful Android port of the [QuizMaster](https://github.com/Monyechi/QuizMaster) ASP.NET MVC web application.

## How This Project Came About

This app started as a full migration exercise: take an existing ASP.NET MVC + Entity Framework classroom quiz platform and rebuild it as a native Android application in Kotlin while keeping feature parity.

The goal was not just a UI clone, but a platform rewrite that demonstrates practical Android engineering decisions:

- Replace server-side session/auth flows with local-first mobile auth and session persistence
- Convert web controller/data patterns into Android MVVM + repository architecture
- Preserve the Student/Instructor role model, profile workflows, messaging, and quiz lifecycle
- Fix known web-version edge cases during the migration (routing consistency and relational data integrity)

## Technical Description

Quiz Master Android uses a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- `UI Layer`: Fragments + ViewModels expose state via LiveData/StateFlow and handle user events
- `Domain/Data Access`: Repositories coordinate local persistence and remote quiz fetches
- `Local Persistence`: Room entities + DAOs for `User`, `Student`, `Instructor`, and `Message`
- `Dependency Injection`: Hilt wires Room, Retrofit, repositories, and app-scoped services
- `Networking`: Retrofit + OkHttp handles API calls and response mapping

Authentication is implemented locally for demo portability:

- Passwords are hashed with SHA-256 + salt before storage
- Session state is stored in SharedPreferences via `SessionManager`
- Role-aware navigation determines Student vs Instructor dashboard flows after login

## Trivia API Used

Quiz questions come from the **Open Trivia DB API**:

- Base endpoint: `https://opentdb.com/api.php`
- Android client: `TriviaApiService` (Retrofit interface)
- Categories mapped in app: Science (`17`), Math (`19`), History (`23`)
- Difficulty supported: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Question handling: HTML decoding + answer shuffling in the repository layer before presenting to UI

## Quiz Categories

| Category | Open Trivia DB ID |
|---|---|
| Science & Nature | 17 |
| Mathematics | 19 |
| History | 23 |

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Open in Android Studio Hedgehog or later
3. Let Gradle sync
4. Run on emulator or device (min SDK 24)

## Improvements over the Web App

- Fixed the Math/History quiz routing bug (all 3 subjects + all 3 difficulties correctly wired)
- Replaced denormalized `InstructorName` string with a proper FK (`instructorId`) on `StudentEntity`
- Replaced the typo `Reciever` with `receiver` throughout
- Messages use real user IDs instead of plain-string matching
- All quiz logic runs natively (no WebView / JS bridge)
